            Ian Caldewell, a self-styled 'PC tinkerer', refurbishes PCs, and has ways of
            acquiring modems, monitors, CPUs, boxes and RAM - to the point where it has
            become a pastime consuming most of his leisure time. He now has streams of
            people seeking repairs, advice and assistance.

            "Recently, I replaced an old power supply for a couple, and, when they came
            to collect, they asked whether I made house calls.

            I said I could and asked what they needed."

            The lady told Caldewell she'd bought a new wireless mouse, and, since it
            was the last one on display, it didn't come with a box or instructions.

            "I asked her: 'Did you put batteries in it?!'

            She hadn't, of course."

            Neil Meyers, library assistant from Gilles Plains in SA, recalls an
            incident with a part-time computer lecturer a couple of years ago.
            "I work in a vocational education library, and, on night shift,
            library staff are the default computer technicians/troubleshooters.
            One night, this part-time lecturer came to the counter, stating that
            she'd managed to get a CD-ROM disc stuck in the drive. She also said
            she felt a bit foolish, because she was instructing a class in basic
            computing and was unable to solve the problem in front of a room
            full of students. So I wandered over to give her assistance, pushed
            the drive eject button, out popped the tray and... no disc to be
            seen. Before I was able to ask out the obvious question, she piped
            up, 'That's the CD drive? I thought it was the other one!', pointing
            to an old 5.25in floppy disc slot, which was there even though the
            drives themselves had long since been decommissioned. Someone from
            IT got out the disc the next day when they upended the machine and
            it fell out. Then, a week later, after I gave the lecturer her CD
            back, she was back within five minutes, saying, 'You won't believe
            it, I've done it again!' And this was their computing tutor? So
            there I am in front of her class, shaking the heck out of the
            machine. So much for teaching people to handle their computers with
            care!"

            Chris Aitken, a designer and programmer from Camden, NSW, believes his story
            proves that tech support is one of the most stressful jobs on earth. He recalls
            working for a small internet provider in the late '90s, when one of the customers
            was a local police officer.

            "He was also an expert in crashing Windows 98. On one occasion, he brought his
            tower into the office, sat it on the counter, pulled his service pistol out of
            his holster and pointed it straight at the tower, threatening to shoot it.

            Another time he put his (by now very nervous) PC tower onto the counter, again
            took out his pistol, held it by the barrel and started banging the butt of the
            gun onto the top of the computer, quite hard too.

            It's no wonder techies go grey - or bald - early!"

            This is the first we've heard of someone trying to fix a computer by intimidating it.
