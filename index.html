          <h2>THAT'S MY LECTURE</h2>
          <p>
            Neil Meyers, library assistant from Gilles Plains in SA, recalls an
            incident with a part-time computer lecturer a couple of years ago.
            "I work in a vocational education library, and, on night shift,
            library staff are the default computer technicians/troubleshooters.
            One night, this part-time lecturer came to the counter, stating that
            she'd managed to get a CD-ROM disc stuck in the drive. She also said
            she felt a bit foolish, because she was instructing a class in basic
            computing and was unable to solve the problem in front of a room
            full of students. So I wandered over to give her assistance, pushed
            the drive eject button, out popped the tray and... no disc to be
            seen. Before I was able to ask out the obvious question, she piped
            up, 'That's the CD drive? I thought it was the other one!', pointing
            to an old 5.25in floppy disc slot, which was there even though the
            drives themselves had long since been decommissioned. Someone from
            IT got out the disc the next day when they upended the machine and
            it fell out. Then, a week later, after I gave the lecturer her CD
            back, she was back within five minutes, saying, 'You won't believe
            it, I've done it again!' And this was their computing tutor? So
            there I am in front of her class, shaking the heck out of the
            machine. So much for teaching people to handle their computers with
            care!"

          <h2>COPY, COPY</h2>
          <p>
            David Tune of Boambee, NSW, was reminded of a particularly clever
            pair of IT Diploma students who handed in a joint research
            assignment, complete with the required signed statement that it was
            all their original work. Tune recalls: "Upon reading the work for
            grading, I was incredibly impressed to find three pages of the
            document written in perfect technical German, particularly given
            that the students in question were none too articulate when I asked
            'Sprechen sie Deutsch?'
          </p>
          <p>
            End result: assignment rejected, students counselled and more care
            taken when cutting and pasting to cover assignment work.
